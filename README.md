# About
Code built for freeCodeCamp's roman numeral builder daily coding challenge of December 11, 2025.
The goal is that, given an integer, return its equivalent value in Roman numerals.

# My take
For this, I've only used dart's console template (`dart create -t console .`).
Personally, it's quite verbose for such a challenge, but with it's intent of demonstrating a bit of my skills with coding challenges, testing, and dart in general, I hope that it serves its purpose.
